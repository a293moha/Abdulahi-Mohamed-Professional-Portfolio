                        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm Abdulahi Mohamed, a passionate professional with a diverse background and a love for sports and technology. I'm an enthusiast of soccer, football, basketball, golf, and Formula 1. My love for sports reflects my dynamic and team-oriented nature, both in my personal and professional life. Currently, I work in Supply Chain Management, where I've honed my skills in various management styles to produce tangible results. My journey began with a Bachelor of Science degree, which laid the foundation for my career. Over the years, I've gained valuable experience in different industries, including pharmaceuticals and supply chain distribution. I pride myself on my ability to learn and adapt quickly in fast-paced, results-driven environments. This adaptability has been crucial in my career progression and problem-solving abilities. Recently, I've taken an interest in coding. I am currently taking a Coding Boot Camp at the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies, where I learned JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I'm excited about the opportunities this new skill set opens up, and I look forward to using my knowledge to solve real-world problems. Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities!</p>
